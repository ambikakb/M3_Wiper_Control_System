## INTRODUCTION

*   Wiper control system is an essential system that used to wipe the raindrops, dust or any water from the windshield.
*   Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windshiels. 
*   Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on front glass. 
*   The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.
*   The warm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move. 
*   Now a days we have an automatic wiper control whenever we stop wiping in between the process it will automatically come to initial position this is the new wiper system as behind in the wiper arm.

## OBJECTIVE

*   To remove the raindrops, dust oilor any water from the windshield.

## 4W'S and 1H

## Where

*   Most of the vehicles have two wipers on the windshield, one on the rear windshield and the other on the front windshield. Some of have a single wiper system.

## Why

*   The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the wind screen sufficiently to provide clear visibility at all the time.

## When 

*   The main purpose is to be clear the windshield from rain, oil, dust and snow. So that we use wiper whenever these things get stuck to the windshield.

## What 

*   Wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, it is used to remove the dust, water, oil and snow.

## How

*   Wiper systems are operated by an electric motor which is attached to a worn gear. It transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.


## SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strength

*   Decrease the accidental situation.
*   Decreases the environmental pollution.
*   Decreases the fuel consumption.
*   Increase safety.
*   Capacity increases under shot gaps.

## Weakness

*   Limited speed.
*   Capacity decreases under conservative gaps.
*   cost is high.
*   high maintenance 
*   can be frustrating at low penetration rates.

## opportunities

*   Technology maturity may reduce system cost.
*   Enables novel MTM applications.

## Threats

*   User acceptance in terms of both purchase intention and frequent activation after purchase.
*   cost.
*   MTM delayed adaptation.

## High Level Requirements

| Test ID |	Description |	
| ------- | ------------- | 
| H_01 | Proper Hardware materials.|
| H_02 | Wiper should be connected to Windshield.|
| H_03 | It requires missionary conditions.|
| H_04 | To start that the the material is to be removed should be  on the screen.|

## Low Level Requirements

| Test ID |	Description |
| ------- | -------------- | 
| L_01	| System should work properly. |
| L_02 | Required amount of power is needed. |
| L_03	| High maintanance is required. |
| L_04  | When antifreeze washer fluid is used,it can help the wipers. |
