## INTRODUCTION

*   Wiper control system is an essential system that used to wipe the raindrops, dust or any water from the windshield.
*   Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windshiels. 
*   Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on front glass. 
*   The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.
*   The warm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move. 
*   Now a days we have an automatic wiper control whenever we stop wiping in between the process it will automatically come to initial position this is the new wiper system as behind in the wiper arm.
