# Abstract

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen.The objectives of this project to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with
the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper.In spite of removing water from windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a Peripheral Interface Controller.Wiper control system is an essential system that used to wipe the raindrops, dust or any water from the windshield.
Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windshiels.Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on front glass.
The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots.
The warm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.
Now a days we have an automatic wiper control whenever we stop wiping in between the process it will automatically come to initial position this is the new wiper system as behind in the wiper arm.
